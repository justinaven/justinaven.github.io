    <p>This was one of the first "branding sites" I built for LifeWay. At the time, this was the first time we were able to build out pages on LifeWay.com that had a custom look, yet still set within the overarching frame of the parent site.</p>
    <p>This group of pages was coded to be both responsive and static. At the time, we had a separate mobile site that ommitted all of this type of content. Getting this content into mobile was tricky due to the mobile site's archetecture, but we did. The mobile site pulled the html from the desktop site and then reference a different stylesheet for mobile. Through the use of sass, I styled a base.scss and generated both a desktop and a mobile stylesheet, each with custom styles (static vs resposive), pulling in the base.scss first.</p>
