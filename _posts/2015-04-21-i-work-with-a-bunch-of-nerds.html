title: I Work with a Bunch of Nerds
---

<p>The other day, my coworkers (and good friends) were ALL discussing the new Star Wars trailer. Amongst the conversation, I happened to mention that I had bits and pieces of the movies but had never seen any of them all of the way through. I'm pretty sure I heard a record screech to a stop and all heads tuned my way. That opened the door for all sorts of criticism [joking]. Then I realized, I'm the "uncool" one of the group.</p>
<p>Minutes later, the subject had changed to comic books, and I was back in the game. </p>
<p>Yeah. It's like that.</p>
