title:  'Respect the Trade'
subtitle: 'Remembering a Conversation with a Previous Manager'

<p>When I was fairly new the front-end game, my department was pulled out of IT and absorbed into another division.  Before the move was complete, one of my coworkers and I were kept in IT and placed in another department. Our jobs essentially stayed the same, but there would be new opportunities. Change is constant. I get it.</p>

<p>One day, about 6 months later, my new manager decided that we should talk about my future.  This was really the first time I had any real discussion with my new manager. He asked me a few typical managerial questions, like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>So, what is it that you do?</li>
  <li>What do you do and would you like to do?</li>
  <li>What would you like to be doing in the next few years?</li>
</ul>

<p>My answers were simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I'm a UX/UI developer for our company's commerce site.</li>
  <li>I'm passionate about responsive design and building great customer experiences. </li>
  <li>In 5 years, I'd like to be doing what I'm doing, except doing it better and doing it more.</li>
</ul>

<p>My answers were met with somewhat of a Lumbergh look. He started to explain that his back-end devs are starting to build everything from back to front, and that they may not have a need for purely front-end devs some day. He followed this explanation with, "We're not looking at letting you go, so don't think this&#8230;"</p>

<p><em>I'm thinking this just took an awkward turn.</em> </p>

<p>He continued,"I just want to start getting you the training you need to be successful in this field. Would you be interested in learning Java?".</p>

<p><em>&#8230;No. Not particularly.</em></p>

<p>I've done back-end coding, but I am no expert, and I have no desire to do anymore of it. I know that it is needed and I'd rather leave that to the experts, because they'll do it better. All of this to say, have respect for the trade that isn't yours. Whatever it is. Back-end vs front-end. Front-end vs UX/UI design. UX/UI design vs print design. And so on and so on&#8230;</p>

<p>By the way, that manager ended up pulling in a UX/front-end dev from my old area to redo/fix the UI and UX work on that project.</p>

<p>Just saying&#8230; respect the trade.</p>
