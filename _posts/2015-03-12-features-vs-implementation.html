title:  '"It HAS all these great features" vs Implementation'
---

<p>Sometimes, when features are presented to us from the seller, the product sounds amazing. It can do so much!! It's too good to be true. And it often is, and you were sold lots of assembly required. </p>
<p>I say this from the standpoint of the person that is handed the tool to use and now I need to run through a gauntlet of coding to get the "out-of-the-box" features to work.</p>
<p>Most of the time it's like, "this new car comes with new thick tread tires, the latest tech audio system, and a hand that will reach out from the dash and stroke your beard for you as you think and drive." So you buy the car and upon delivery you discover that the new features are included, but are located in the trunk unassembled. "Oh! You wanted them on the car? Oh, we don't do that, but we can recommend a great company that knows our products who you can contract to install these new features."</p>
<p>To those in procurement, please don't buy without the sign off of someone that actually has to implement. They can let you know just how much time and effort it will take to implement, and if the unicorn really does exist. Deal? Phew... I feel better about this already. In future news, everyone listened to the craftsman and never bought anything again because nothing works right out of the box as promised</p>
<p>I'm just kidding. No one listens to the craftsman.</p>
